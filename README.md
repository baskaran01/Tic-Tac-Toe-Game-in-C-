# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game in C++

A simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game written in **C++**.

This project is a basic implementation of the classic two-player Tic Tac Toe game with **object-oriented programming**, **input validation**, and **win detection**. It's built purely for learning and will be improved step-by-step in future versions.

## 🧠 Features

- Two-player console game (`X` and `O`)
- Validates user input (prevents overwriting existing moves)
- Detects winners in:
  - All rows
  - All columns
  - Both diagonals
- Displays winner or draw result
- Clean, beginner-friendly code

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** Visual Studio
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub

---

## 📋 Project Description
- A two-player game played on the console.
- The board is displayed after every move.
- Players input their desired position by specifying the row and column.
- Input validation ensures only valid indices (1-3) are accepted.

---

## 📌 Version

**Current Version:** `v1.1 - Win Detection & Validation Update`

🔄 **What's new in v1.1**
- Converted game into a class-based structure
- Added input validation for legal moves
- Implemented win detection logic
- Announces winner or draw at game end

`v1 - Object-Oriented Update`

- Added C++ Class structure
- Prevents overwriting cells
- Better input validation
- Prepares for winner detection feature

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add player name input
- Implement score tracking
- Add "Play Again" option
- Refactor and modularize more
- Explore GUI-based version using libraries like SDL or SFML

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Enter two numbers representing the **row** and **column** (both from 1 to 3).
3. Player 1 uses **'X'**, Player 2 uses **'O'**.
4. The game alternates between players for 9 moves.

> **Note**: Winner checking and preventing overwriting cells are not yet implemented.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Save the leatest version code to a file called `tic_tac_toe.cpp`.
2. Compile the code using:
   ```bash
   g++ tic_tac_toe.cpp -o tic_tac_toe
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./tic_tac_toe
   ```

** OR **

I also upload .exe file just download and play
