# Tic Tac Toe Game in C++

Welcome to a simple console-based **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **C++**!  
Players take turns placing their marks ("X" and "O") on a 3x3 board until the board is filled.

---

## 📋 Project Description
- A two-player game played on the console.
- The board is displayed after every move.
- Players input their desired position by specifying the row and column.
- Input validation ensures only valid indices (1-3) are accepted.

---
## 📌 Version

**Current Version:** `v1 - Object-Oriented Update`

- Added C++ Class structure
- Prevents overwriting cells
- Better input validation
- Prepares for winner detection feature

---

## 🎯 Future Roadmap
- Add winner detection logic
- Announce the winner or draw
- Add option to replay

---

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Enter two numbers representing the **row** and **column** (both from 1 to 3).
3. Player 1 uses **'X'**, Player 2 uses **'O'**.
4. The game alternates between players for 9 moves.

> **Note**: Winner checking and preventing overwriting cells are not yet implemented.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Save the code to a file called `tic_tac_toe.cpp`.
2. Compile the code using:
   ```bash
   g++ tic_tac_toe.cpp -o tic_tac_toe
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
